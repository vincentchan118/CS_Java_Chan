//a. the first line of code imports the scanner class.
//b. the sets the keyboard as the scanner.
//c. the system creates a separate variable for each piece of information. For example line 13 and 14 direct the keyboard input to the name variable.
//d: The error means that the Int is used for intigers and not words.
//e: The difference is that the println moves the the cursor to a new line but the print does not.
